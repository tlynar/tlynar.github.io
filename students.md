### Harriet Farlow 
Harriet Farlow is the CEO and Founder of Mileva Security Labs. With a decade of experience at the intersection of AI and cyber security, Harriet is a recognised leader in her field.
Harriet's journey began at Deloitte Australia, where she specialised in Defence portfolio projects as a Senior Consultant. Her career also spans roles as a Data Scientist at the University of Sydney and as Senior Delivery Lead at a tech education start-up in New York City. She returned to Canberra to work for the Australian Government, where she served at the intersection of data science, cyber security, and national security, eventually becoming an acting Tech Director.
She holds a degree in Physics and Bio-anthropology, along with a Master's in Cyber Security. In 2021 she commenced a PhD in Machine Learning Security. This is where she encountered AI Security and adversarial machine learning for the first time.
In 2023, Harriet founded Mileva Security Labs, driven by her mission to raise awareness about AI system vulnerabilities and provide solutions to secure them. Her work ensures that organisations are equipped to defend against threats and protect their AI systems from disruption and compromise.
She is also a passionate communicator, as the host of The AI Security Podcast, through her YouTube channel HarrietHacks, and as a speaker at BSides and DEF CON.

### Musa Phiri

Musa Phiri is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UNSW Canberra, specializing in Deep Transfer Learning. My research focuses on developing a landscape-aware framework for automatic hyperparameter selection, leveraging landscape analysis and optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of transfer learning models.

Musa holds a Master of Science in Data Science and Big Data from Mulungushi University, where his dissertation explored deep hybrid learning models for photovoltaic solar tracking systems, and a Master of Science in Project Management from the University of Zambia, focusing on forecasting methodologies for construction projects. Hw also completed my Bachelor of Science in Statistics at Mulungushi University.

Musa's research experience spans predictive modeling, machine learning, and deep learning applications across NLP, renewable energy, and health domains. He has expertise in both supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as optimization techniques for AI models. His work has resulted in publications in high-impact journals including IEEE Access and Solar Energy, with particular recognition for my systematic literature review on deep learning techniques for solar tracking systems. Beyond research, Musa is passionate about applying AI-driven solutions to real-world challenges and contributing to advancements in deep learning methodologies.
