### Hassan Wasswa

![bio photo](https://tlynar.github.io/img/hassan-bio.jpg)

Hassan Wasswa is a Ph.D. candidate in Cybersecurity at the University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia. He holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Kyambogo University, Uganda, and an M.Sc. from the University of Malaya, Malaysia. He has held academic roles at the International University of East Africa and the Islamic University in Uganda, and was a research fellow at Texas Tech University, USA, from 2020 to 2022. He has also worked as an AI research consultant at ICT Skills Development Center Ltd in Kampala. His research interests include IoT security, representation learning, image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language understanding, and information security.

#### Research Interests

Hassan's research focuses on developing lightweight, efficient, and robust deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. With the rapid growth of IoT devices and applications, legacy security solutions such as antivirus software and signature-based IDS have proven inadequate due to the constrained computational resources, memory limitations, and dynamic nature of IoT networks. The research addresses key challenges in IoT botnet detection, including class imbalance, high-dimensional traffic data, and frequent concept drifts. The proposed approach leverages low-dimensional latent space representations—extracted using models like the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Vision Transformer (ViT)—to enhance detection performance and efficiency. Additionally, the work incorporates data augmentation, cost-sensitive learning, and latent space alignment to mitigate data imbalance and adapt to evolving attack patterns. Finally, to ensure deployment feasibility on resource-limited IoT devices, the thesis explores model compression through quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), aiming to reduce storage and inference costs without compromising detection accuracy.
